# Bouncy-Deer

This is a game made with the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/) in one moth for Christmas.
It's a physics based puzzle game where you launch your deer and carefully place objects such as trampolines and cannons to get it to the goal.

Feel free to examine the code or use it for any purpose, just credit me in some way.
You can play the game on my website [aerolite.dev](https://aerolite.dev/en/games/bouncy-deer) or on [itch.io](https://milanvarady.itch.io/bouncy-deer).
